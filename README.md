# Arcane Game Engine

A Java framework for making 2D games because I was fed up with Unity being horribly over-engineered
for the simple card game I wanted to make.

Note that this version of the framework does rendering on CPU. Integration with OpenGL is something
I fully intend to implement down-the-line.

## Releases

### Goals for upcoming Snapshot 0.2

- Add support for movement mechanics and animations.
- Extend API for keyboard-mouse events to give players the potential for full control over
  components.
- Add scene transitions. 

### Snapshot 0.1 - Initial prototype

- Added support for basic 2D shapes and shaders.
- Introduced API for keyboard-mouse events.
